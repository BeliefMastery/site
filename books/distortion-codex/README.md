## What This Book Is

**The Sovereignty-Distortion Codex: A Structural Exposure of Sovereignty Obstruction Patterns and Archetypal Manipulation Machinery**

A book by Warwick Marshall that maps recurring structural distortions that erode will, fragment coherence, and hijack perception.

## Description

The Codex maps recurring structural distortions that erode will, fragment coherence, and hijack perception. Reinterpreting historical and mythological figures as impersonal archetypal patterns, it catalogs the Central Seven collapse sequence alongside fragmentation, coping mechanisms, meaning collapse, and cultural execution engines.

## Key Features

- Recognition heuristics for collapse sequences and mimicry patterns
- Seduction strategy analysis to reveal how ideals or beauty can be co-opted
- Diagnostic flows for early intervention in group or individual dynamics
- Repair pathways that restore authorship by reattaching cost and accountability
