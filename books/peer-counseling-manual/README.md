## What This Book Is

**The Peer-Counseling Manual: A Decentralized Framework for Self-Authorship and Emotional Integration**

A book by Warwick Marshall that provides a technical, non-clinical framework for establishing and running peer-led support groups.

## Description

A technical, non-clinical framework for establishing and running peer-led support groups without hierarchical oversight or financial barriers. Built on a rigorous structure of timed sessions, rotating roles (Client, Counselor, Witness), and explicit ongoing consent, the model facilitates "The Work": emotional integration through discharge of stored tension in the presence of disciplined, non-intrusive witnesses.

## Key Features

- Egalitarian framework with rotating roles and equal turns
- Safe access to intimate psychological states like locked eye contact
- Distributed group responsibility with clear hazard controls
- Experiential learning that builds durable skills through practice
