## What This Book Is

**Sovereign of Mind: Cognitive Sovereignty in a Manipulated World**

A book by Warwick Marshall that fortifies the architecture that thinking stands on—securing authorship against systems and interests that seek to claim it.

## Description

Your thoughts may not always be your own. In a world built for persuasion, mimicry, and dependency, most minds operate on borrowed scaffolding—trauma, culture, ideology. **Sovereign of Mind** is the structural antidote.

## Key Features

- Secure conscious authorship of thought and will
- Expand perception and discernment
- Build your paradigm deliberately upon frameworks that can withstand contradiction
- Recognize and neutralize manipulation vectors
- Master relational dynamics without surrendering sovereignty
- Map internal architecture to restore coherence and integrity

## Approach

Sovereign of Mind forges cognitive infrastructure—the sword and sheath for those who choose to think, live, and act by structures of their own design.

## Purchase

Available on Amazon: [Sovereign of Mind](https://www.amazon.com/Sovereign-Mind-Cognitive-Manipulation-Authorship-ebook/dp/B0F9VJK911)
