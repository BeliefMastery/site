## What This Book Is

**Sovereign Integral Devotionalism: A Post-Doctrinal, Cross-Mystical, Relationally-Rooted Metaphysic of Divine Coherence**

A book by Warwick Marshall that reclaims the sacred through structural coherence.

## Description

A post-doctrinal spiritual framework that reclaims the sacred through structural coherence. Not a new religion but an architecture left standing when untested beliefs collapse. The core tenet: coherence—internal consistency sustained under external contradiction—is the ultimate test for all truth.

## Key Features

- Coherence as the foundational test for all truth and devotion
- Post-theistic ontology defining God as structural coherence
- Sovereignty as the primary spiritual competency
- Rejection of salvation dependency in favor of self-reconstruction
