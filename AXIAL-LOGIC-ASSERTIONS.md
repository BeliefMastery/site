## Cell-by-cell logic

### hi goodGuy (high commitment signal)

| Bad Boy | Combination | Woman's perspective | Asserted label | Notes |
|---------|--------------|---------------------|----------------|-------|
| **lo** | High commitment, low attraction | He'll invest, protect, provide — but she doesn't feel strong chemistry. Safe choice for nesting. **Prime gold digger target** (maximum provider, minimum attraction required). | Prince Charming (Ideal Long Term) | ✓ Logical. Add (warning: will attract Gold Diggers). |
| **mid** | High commitment, decent attraction | She wants him for both. Marriage material. | Husband zone | ✓ Logical. Gold diggers also target here (high provider). |
| **hi** | High commitment, high attraction | He has both. Why friend zone? Possible readings: (a) Too safe — no chase, she takes him for granted; (b) Combination reads as non-sexual/brotherly; (c) She keeps him for value (support, access) without mating. | Friend zone | ⚠ Ambiguous. Needs your confirmation. Alternative: could be "Ideal" / "The One" if hi-hi = best of both. |

### mid goodGuy (moderate commitment signal)

| Bad Boy | Combination | Woman's perspective | Asserted label | Notes |
|---------|--------------|---------------------|----------------|-------|
| **lo** | Moderate commitment, low attraction | Reliable but not exciting. Safe bet, backup. | Good Catch | ✓ Logical. |
| **mid** | Moderate both | Middle of the road. Good enough, not wanted. | Settling... | ✓ Logical. |
| **hi** | Moderate commitment, **high attraction** | He's exciting, she's drawn to him — for chemistry, status, thrill. **Gold diggers want hi goodGuy (provider).** This is mid provider. She pursues him for his appeal, not primarily for resources. | **INCORRECT: Gold Digger Ick** | ✗ **Wrong cell.** Gold digger = targets high provider (hi goodGuy). Correct: she sees him as **Prize** or **Desirable** — worth pursuing for his attraction. Optional: (warning: some pursue for status/ego) — different from gold digger. |

### lo goodGuy (low commitment signal)

| Bad Boy | Combination | Woman's perspective | Asserted label | Notes |
|---------|--------------|---------------------|----------------|-------|
| **lo** | Low both | Nothing to offer. Invisible or threatening. | Invisible/Ghost or Creep | ✓ Logical. |
| **mid** | Low commitment, moderate attraction | She might hook up; he won't commit. | ... Mistake | ✓ Logical. |
| **hi** | Low commitment, high attraction | Exciting, chemistry — but not reliable. Short-term only. | Bad Boy (Short Term) | ✓ Logical. |

## Where Gold Digger belongs

**Gold digger** = woman who pursues for resources/status, not genuine connection. She targets **high provider signal** → **hi goodGuy**.

- **Prince Charming (hi-lo):** Prime target — all provider, low attraction. She can be with him purely for security.
- **Husband zone (hi-mid):** Also targeted — strong provider + presentable.

The **(warning: will attract Gold Diggers)** belongs on **hi goodGuy** cells, not mid-hi.
