## Key Concepts and Frameworks

### Belief Inference Process
A systematic, repeatable method for identifying and dismantling subconscious structures that govern perception, behavior, and identity. The process traces emotional reactivity to unmet needs and resolves them at the root through disciplined logic and embodied insight.

### Structural Sovereignty
The capacity to author one's inner world, map causality, and assert will. Sovereignty is restored through identifying distortion patterns, withdrawing consent from them, and re-establishing personal authorship.

### Core Principles
- **Structural Precision**: I.T.-honed diagnostics to map self-reinforcing belief loops
- **Root-Level Resolution**: Using clarity and contradiction to dismantle foundations
- **Sovereign Self-Parenting**: Restoring agency and internal alignment

## Technical Implementation

### Architecture
- **Single-Page Application**: All content accessible via anchor links within `index.html`
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with hamburger menu navigation
- **Background Crossfade**: Dynamic background transitions between sections
- **Dropdown Navigation**: "Works" menu consolidating all book links

### Technologies
- HTML5 with semantic markup
- CSS3 with custom properties (CSS variables)
- Vanilla JavaScript for interactivity (no frameworks)
- GitHub Pages deployment

### SEO Optimization
- Structured data (JSON-LD) for book schema
- Open Graph and Twitter Card meta tags
- Semantic HTML with proper ARIA labels
- Descriptive alt text for images
