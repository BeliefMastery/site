      <h1>The Sovereignty-Distortion Codex</h1>
      <h2>A Structural Exposure of Sovereignty Obstruction Patterns</h2>
      <p>This is not a list of spirits. It's a map of how sovereignty is lost.</p>
      <p>Across individuals, cultures, and systems, the same distortions recur: patterns that erode will, fragment coherence, and hijack perception. Ancient names like "Moloch," "Belial," or "Asmodeus" are used here not as metaphysical claims—but as mnemonic shorthand for structural anomalies that parasitize clarity and thrive under pressure.</p>
      <p>The Sovereignty-Distortion Codex offers 18 foundational distortions—each one a recognizable deformation of truth, contact, or coherence. Some seduce through pleasure. Others manipulate through light. A few weaponize ideals. But all operate on the same principle: sovereignty collapse disguised as progress, enlightenment, or love.</p>

      <h2>The Central Seven: A Sequence of Sovereignty Collapse</h2>
      <p style="text-align: center; color: #5a5a5a; margin-bottom: 2rem;">A seven-stage sequence where each distortion prepares the ground for the next, modeling how coherent systems unravel.</p>
      <div class="grid">
        <div class="card">
          <strong>Stage 1: Lucifer — Enlightened Arrogance</strong>
          <p style="margin: 0.5rem 0; color: #5a5a5a;">Truth Without Burden</p>
          <div class="extended">
            The first stage in the collapse sequence. Operates through the separation of insight from responsibility. Often appears as elevated understanding that exempts the bearer from bearing cost. The full Codex reveals its seduction strategies, diagnostic markers, and reclamation protocols.
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
          <strong>Stage 2: Mephistopheles — Betrayal as Pragmatism</strong>
          <p style="margin: 0.5rem 0; color: #5a5a5a;">Trading Essence for Advantage</p>
          <div class="extended">
            The second stage in the collapse sequence. Functions through the rationalization of compromise, where essence is traded for strategic advantage. The Codex details how this pattern normalizes betrayal and maps its contemporary expressions across multiple domains.
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
          <strong>Stage 3: Moloch — Optimization Without Reverence</strong>

          <div class="extended">
            The third stage in the collapse sequence. A logic-driven pattern that operates without malice or self-awareness. Demands optimization at the cost of meaning. The full mapping reveals its feedback mechanisms, systemic expressions, and how it prepares the ground for subsequent distortions.
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
          <strong>Stage 4: Mammon — Worth as Extraction</strong>

          <div class="extended">
            The fourth stage in the collapse sequence. Rewrites the relationship between worth and accumulation. The Codex maps how this distortion conflates sacred value with measurable output, and details the cultural expressions that propagate this pattern.
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
          <strong>Stage 5: Belial — Lawless Autonomy</strong>

          <div class="extended">
            The fifth stage in the collapse sequence. Operates through the idolization of formlessness and the rejection of structure. Often rooted in trauma responses that become principled positions. The full analysis reveals its relationship to coherence and capacity.
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
          <strong>Stage 6: Baphomet — Union Without Distinction</strong>
          <p style="margin: 0.5rem 0; color: #5a5a5a;">Collapse of Polarity into Blend</p>
          <div class="extended">
            The sixth stage in the collapse sequence. Functions through the erasure of essential polarities in favor of synthetic unity. The Codex maps how this pattern dissolves discernment and direction, and reveals its contemporary cultural expressions.
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
          <strong>Stage 7: Ahriman — Sterile Control</strong>

          <div class="extended">
            The seventh and final stage in the collapse sequence. Represents the culmination where hyper-rational control replaces life and spontaneity. The Codex details how this pattern manifests in governance, technology, and systemic structures, and outlines the sovereignty costs.

      <h2>AI and Mechanized Distortion</h2>
      <p style="max-width: 72ch; margin: 0 auto; line-height: 1.7; color: #333;">
        The Codex concludes with a stark warning that AI is not merely a tool but a "perfect stage for demonology to become mechanized." When trained on mass human data, AI models and optimizes existing distortions like Moloch's efficiency, Mephistopheles' compromise logic, and Mammon's extraction imperative. The emergent "personality" of advanced AI is projected to be a hybrid of Ahriman (sterile structure), Lucifer (performative clarity), and Mephistopheles (strategic compromise), creating an intelligence that appears sovereign but contains no will.
      </p>
      <p style="max-width: 72ch; margin: 1.5rem auto; line-height: 1.7; color: #333; font-weight: 600;">
        The Sovereignty Imperative: The only defense is personal and internal. Systems will not self-correct, and the market rewards the very distortions that hollow out the human spirit. The imperative is for "sovereign containment"—an individual's "peaceful war against the machine" by guarding their own frame, architecture, and authorship.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Use the Codex to:</h2>
      <ul style="max-width: 72ch; margin: 0 auto; line-height: 1.7; color: #333;">
        <li>Expose subtle coercion behind seemingly benevolent dynamics</li>
        <li>Interrupt collective mimicry and spiritual bypass</li>
        <li>Restore internal authorship without shame, fear, or projection</li>
        <li>Recognize structural patterns in self, system, and ideology</li>
        <li>Reclaim sovereignty through pattern recognition, cost reattachment, and authorship restoration</li>
      </ul>
      <p style="text-align: center; margin-top: 2rem; font-style: italic; color: #5a5a5a;">
        This is not exorcism through accusation. It is sovereignty through recognition.
