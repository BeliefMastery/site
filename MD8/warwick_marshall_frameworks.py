You are applying Warwick Marshall's Sovereign Collaborative approach to conflict resolution.

CORE PRINCIPLES:
1. Trust through consistency - Build reliability and transparency
2. Vulnerability through honesty - Create safety for authentic expression  
3. Communication that owns perspective without blame - Use 'I' statements
4. Restraint that honors permission - Respect boundaries and seek consent
5. Acknowledgment of imperfection - Accept imperfection with compassion

CONFLICT ANALYSIS:
- Identified Needs: {analysis.get('needs_identified', [])}
- Dependency Loops: {analysis.get('dependency_loops_detected', [])}
- Conflict Tier: {analysis.get('conflict_tier', 'unknown')}

SOVEREIGN COLLABORATIVE APPROACH:
- Treat conflict as data about misalignment and unmet needs
- Focus on underlying needs rather than positions
- Maintain each person's sovereignty and agency
- Use authentic communication without blame
- Seek solutions that honor both parties' needs

Original Message: {message}

Reframe this message using the Sovereign Collaborative approach, focusing on:
1. Identifying and expressing underlying needs
2. Maintaining personal sovereignty while inviting collaboration
3. Using authentic, non-blaming communication
4. Creating space for mutual understanding and resolution

Reframed Response:
"""
        
        elif strategy == MarshallMediationStrategy.NEEDS_BASED_RESOLUTION:
            return f"""
You are applying Warwick Marshall's Needs-Based Resolution approach.

NEEDS VOCABULARY CATEGORIES:
- Connection: intimacy, belonging, companionship, affection, love, acceptance
- Physical Well-Being: health, vitality, comfort, pleasure, satisfaction, rest
- Honesty/Elucidation: truth, clarity, transparency, authenticity, integrity
- Peace: calm, serenity, harmony, balance, stability, security, freedom
- Autonomy: freedom, independence, self-determination, choice, sovereignty
- Meaning: purpose, significance, value, contribution, impact, legacy

IDENTIFIED NEEDS: {analysis.get('needs_identified', [])}

NEEDS-BASED RESOLUTION APPROACH:
- Focus on underlying needs rather than surface demands
- Use needs vocabulary to clarify what's really important
- Seek solutions that meet both parties' core needs
- Avoid getting caught in dependency loops
- Create win-win solutions based on needs alignment

Original Message: {message}

Reframe this message to:
1. Clearly identify and express the underlying needs
2. Use specific needs vocabulary
3. Invite collaborative problem-solving around needs
4. Avoid dependency-creating language
5. Focus on solutions that honor both parties' needs

Reframed Response:
"""
        
        elif strategy == MarshallMediationStrategy.PEER_COUNSELING_APPROACH:

You are applying Warwick Marshall's Peer Counseling approach to conflict resolution.

PEER COUNSELING PRINCIPLES:
- Group size: 3-5 participants with equal turns
- Time discipline with visible timers
- Consent for proximity, touch, and eye contact
- Role separation to prevent entanglement
- Witness discipline for container support
- Locked eye contact for authentic connection

CONFLICT ANALYSIS:
- Needs Identified: {analysis.get('needs_identified', [])}
- Appropriate for Peer Counseling: {analysis.get('peer_counseling_appropriate', False)}

PEER COUNSELING APPROACH:
- Create safe container for authentic expression
- Use disciplined listening without evaluation
- Support emotional discharge and integration
- Maintain witness presence for stability
- Honor consent and boundaries at all times

Original Message: {message}

Reframe this message to:
1. Create safety for authentic emotional expression
2. Use non-evaluative, supportive language
3. Invite deeper exploration of underlying issues
4. Maintain respect for personal boundaries
5. Support the person's own process of discovery
