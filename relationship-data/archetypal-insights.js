  vulnerability: {
    description: 'Each gender carries inherent vulnerability: the masculine fractures at the edge of shame, the feminine at the edge of fear. These are survival codes written into the human field.',

      masculine: [
        'When addressing relationship issues with a masculine partner, avoid triggering shame. Focus on solutions and competence rather than failure.',
        'Masculine vulnerability surfaces when competence, control, or courage are questioned. Support through acknowledgment of strength, not criticism of weakness.',

      feminine: [
        'When addressing relationship issues with a feminine partner, avoid triggering fear. Create safety and security before addressing problems.',
        'Feminine vulnerability surfaces when safety, connection, or belonging are threatened. Support through presence and reassurance, not logic or solutions.',

  biologicalEssentialism: {
    description: 'Biological essentialism asserts that human behavior and identity are deeply rooted in biological traits shaped by evolutionary forces. These traits influence everything from individual instincts to societal structures.',
    application: [
      'Some relationship needs are hardwired, not negotiable. Recognize the difference between preferences and biological imperatives.',
      'Evolutionary pressures shape mate selection, status dynamics, and attachment patterns. Understanding these can reduce personalization of conflicts.',
      'Hormonal and psychological foundations influence behavior. Testosterone drives dominance and provision; oxytocin drives bonding and caregiving.',
      'Social synergies reflect evolutionary strategies. Cooperation, competition, and resource allocation operate at both conscious and instinctual levels.',
      'Cultural evolution amplifies biological patterns. Relationship dynamics often echo deeper evolutionary imperatives.'

  polarity: {
    description: 'Polarity functions as complementary alignment. The masculine steadies, holds, and leads; the feminine tests, amplifies, and confirms. Clean polarity stabilizes and energizes both; collapsed polarity corrodes into resentment and control.',
    application: [
      'Healthy relationships require both masculine and feminine energies, regardless of gender. Both partners need to access both, but typically one is dominant.',
      'Clean polarity creates charge and attraction. Collapsed polarity (sameness, no distinction) leads to boredom and resentment.',
      'Masculine energy provides structure, direction, and containment. Feminine energy provides flow, presence, and testing.',
      'Polarity dynamics influence communication: masculine tends toward problem-solving, feminine toward emotional processing. Both are necessary.',
      'Boundaries are essential for maintaining polarity. Collapsed boundaries erode masculine/feminine dynamics.',
      'Conflict resolution supports polarity when it creates charge and resolution rather than collapse into sameness or control.'
