  'core-values': {
    immediate: [
      'Schedule dedicated time to discuss your core values explicitly. Create a safe space where both partners can share what matters most without judgment.',
      'Identify specific areas where values align and celebrate these as relationship strengths.',
      'For areas of misalignment, explore whether differences are fundamental incompatibilities or areas where understanding and compromise are possible.',
      'Consider whether value differences are deal-breakers or opportunities for growth and mutual respect.'
    ],
    structural: [
      'Establish regular "values check-ins" to ensure alignment remains clear as you both grow and evolve.',
      'Create shared rituals or practices that honor both partners\' core values.',
      'Develop a framework for making decisions that respects both value systems.',
      'Seek professional guidance if value conflicts are creating persistent relationship strain.'
    ],
    archetypal: [
      'Recognize that value alignment operates at both biological and cultural levels. Some differences may stem from deep-seated evolutionary patterns.',
      'Consider how masculine/feminine polarity dynamics may influence value expression and negotiation.',
      'Understand that vulnerability (masculine at shame, feminine at fear) may surface when core values are challenged.'
    ]
  },
  'trust-reliability': {
    immediate: [
      'If trust has been broken, create a clear plan for rebuilding that includes specific, measurable actions.',
      'Practice radical honesty: commit to transparency even when it\'s uncomfortable.',
      'Follow through on commitments consistently, no matter how small.',
      'Acknowledge when you cannot meet a commitment and communicate this proactively.'
    ],
    structural: [
      'Establish clear expectations about reliability and communicate these explicitly.',
      'Create systems for accountability that support trust-building (e.g., regular check-ins, shared calendars).',
      'Address trust violations immediately rather than allowing them to accumulate.',
      'Consider the role of biological essentialism: trust operates at both conscious and instinctual levels.'
    ],
    archetypal: [
      'Understand that trust is foundational to reproductive confidence (4P\'s: Perspicacity, Protector, Provider, Parental Investor).',
      'Recognize that trust violations trigger deep survival responses that require both emotional and structural repair.',

    structural: [
      'Develop a shared vocabulary for discussing boundaries that both partners understand.',
      'Establish regular boundary check-ins to ensure they remain clear and respected.',
      'Create rituals that honor both autonomy and connection.',
      'Recognize that healthy boundaries support rather than diminish intimacy.'
    ],
    archetypal: [
      'Understand that boundaries are essential for maintaining polarity. Collapsed boundaries erode masculine/feminine dynamics.',
      'Recognize that boundary violations trigger survival responses (fear for feminine, shame for masculine).',
      'Consider how biological essentialism influences boundary needs: some needs are hardwired, not negotiable.'
    ]
  },
  'mutual-support': {
    immediate: [
      'Identify specific ways your partner needs support and commit to providing it consistently.',
      'Ask directly: "How can I support you right now?" rather than assuming.',

    ],
    archetypal: [
      'Understand support through the lens of reproductive confidence: support demonstrates Provider and Protector capacity.',

      'Learn each other\'s communication styles and adapt accordingly.'
    ],
    archetypal: [
      'Recognize that communication operates through both conscious and biological channels. Some responses are instinctual.',
      'Understand that masculine communication tends toward problem-solving, feminine toward emotional processing. Both are valid.',
      'Consider how polarity dynamics influence communication: clean polarity creates charge, collapsed polarity creates confusion.'

      'Recognize that emotional intelligence can be developed through practice and intention.'
    ],
    archetypal: [
      'Understand that emotional responses have biological roots. Some reactions are survival-based, not personal.',

    ],
    archetypal: [
      'Understand that conflict is data: it reveals misalignment, unmet needs, or distortion.',
      'Recognize that healthy conflict resolution supports polarity: it creates charge and resolution rather than collapse.',
