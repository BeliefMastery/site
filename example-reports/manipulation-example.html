        <h3>Manipulation Vector Analysis Results</h3>
        <p>Based on your responses, here are the manipulation vectors identified and recommended strategies.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="vector-result">
        <h3>Primary Vector: Dependency</h3>
        <p>This manipulation creates dependency by making you feel you need the manipulator for validation, support, or identity. They position themselves as essential to your well-being, making it difficult to leave or set boundaries.</p>
        <p><strong>Activation Level:</strong> High - This manipulation is very active and strong</p>
        <p><strong>Score:</strong> 7.5/10 (Weighted: 6.8)</p>
        <p><strong>Pattern Type:</strong> Structural - This is a deep, ongoing pattern that affects your whole life</p>
      </div>

      <div class="supporting-vectors">
        <h4>Supporting Vectors</h4>
        <div class="vector-result">
          <h4>Deception</h4>
          <p>This manipulation involves lying, withholding information, or creating false narratives to control your perception of reality.</p>
          <p><strong>Score:</strong> 5.2/10</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="tactics-section">
        <h4>Identified Tactics</h4>
        <p>These are specific manipulation tactics that may be present in your relationship. Each tactic includes examples and explanations in plain language.</p>
        
        <div class="tactic-item">
          <h5>Covert Entrench</h5>
          <div>
            <strong>How it works:</strong> Hidden/Subtle - Hard to notice, sneaky manipulation • <strong>When it happens:</strong> Control Phase - Happens once they have you, to keep you trapped
          </div>
          <div>
            <strong>Example:</strong>
            <p>"You're so lucky to have me. No one else would put up with you like I do."</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <strong>What it does:</strong>
            <p>This tactic subtly reinforces your dependency by making you feel that the manipulator is doing you a favor by being with you. It creates a sense of indebtedness and makes you question your own worth.</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <strong>How it controls you:</strong>
            <p>By making you feel lucky to have them, they position themselves as valuable and you as less valuable. This creates dependency because you start to believe you can't do better or that you need them for validation.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="tactic-item">
          <h5>Emotional Blackmail</h5>
          <div>
            <strong>How it works:</strong> Hidden/Subtle - Hard to notice, sneaky manipulation • <strong>When it happens:</strong> Control Phase - Happens once they have you, to keep you trapped
          </div>
          <div>
            <strong>Example:</strong>
            <p>"If you really loved me, you would do this for me. I guess you don't care about me after all."</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <strong>What it does:</strong>
            <p>This tactic uses your emotions against you by making you feel guilty or responsible for their feelings. It manipulates your desire to be a good partner or person.</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <strong>How it controls you:</strong>
            <p>By making you feel guilty or like a bad person, they control your behavior. You start doing things you don't want to do just to avoid feeling guilty or to prove you care.</p>
