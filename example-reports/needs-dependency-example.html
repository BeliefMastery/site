          <p class="loop-description">Based on your responses, the SPACE dependency loop shows the strongest alignment with your patterns. This loop involves the need for emotional space and breathing room, where attempts to create distance can trigger feelings of rejection in others, which then intensifies the need for space.</p>

          <h3>High Priority</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Establish Clear Boundaries:</strong> Communicate your need for space proactively rather than reactively. Set clear expectations about when you need alone time and how others can support this need.</li>
            <li><strong>Develop Internal Sources of Joy:</strong> Practice activities that generate joy independently, reducing dependency on others for emotional regulation.</li>

          <h3>Medium Priority</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Practice Conscious Communication:</strong> When you need space, explain it as a need rather than a rejection, helping others understand it's not about them.</li>
            <li><strong>Build Self-Sovereignty:</strong> Develop practices that strengthen your sense of autonomy and self-determination.</li>

          <ul>
            <li>You have identified patterns that can be addressed with conscious awareness</li>
            <li>You have a map for tracing symptoms to root needs</li>
            <li>You can develop greater autonomy and sovereignty through needs consciousness</li>
