      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p><strong>Belief Mastery</strong> (BM) is a structured system for subconscious liberation and self-authorship. It helps uncover and transform core-limiting beliefs, especially those rooted in unmet needs and inherited patterns. BM integrates psychological clarity with strategic tools that support emotional regulation, relational sovereignty, and intentional action. While designed to be self-guided, it also enhances professional work when used alongside tools like CBT, IFS, EMDR, and hypnosis.</p>
