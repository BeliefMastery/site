Dependency in Human Dynamics – Needs-Based Taxonomy and Reference
System</p>
<p class="western" align="left" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">
This section examines how outsourcing specific needs - across domains
such as connection, well-being, honesty, peace, autonomy, and meaning
- creates dependency and strains relationships, revealing the hidden
toll of external reliance.</p>
<p class="western" align="left" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" align="left" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">
Unlike the narrative loop examples presented in Chapter 5, which are
designed to evoke recognition through relational patterning, the
entries here offer a clearer taxonomy and reference system. This
framework mirrors the structure of the comprehensive needs vocabulary
and is intended to support more precise navigation of the Belief
Inference Process.</p>
<p class="western" align="left" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" align="left" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">
Grouped by need domain (e.g., Connection, Peace, Autonomy), each
entry identifies a commonly outsourced need, the typical dependency
structure it produces, the relational consequence that follows, and
the core distortion that emerges over time.</p>
<p class="western" align="left" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">
This guide is designed for quick reference - to assist in identifying
unmet needs beneath behavioral tension, classifying loop tendencies,
and mapping projected consequences across personal inquiry or
coaching sessions.</p>

CONNECTION</p>
<p class="western" align="left" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">
Needs like acceptance, affection, appreciation, belonging, love,
nurturing, respect, safety, security, stability, support, trust,
warmth, and to know/be known or see/be seen are inherently relational
and often sought from others. Outsourcing these can easily create
dependency:</p>
<p class="western" align="left" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">
•	Stability. An individual depends on another to be their emotional
or practical anchor, outsourcing their sense of steadiness. The
burdened party, feeling the weight of expectation, begins to waver,
their own resilience compromised by the responsibility. As they
falter, the seeker’s foundation collapses, and the provider, now
unstable themselves, resents the demand. Stability erodes for both -
one from dependence, the other from strain.</p>
<p class="western" align="left" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" align="left" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">
•	Security. An individual looks to a partner for a sense of safety,
placing the responsibility for their emotional or physical well-being
in another’s hands. The partner, under constant pressure to provide
reassurance, feels their own security compromised, struggling under
the weight of expectation. The more they pull away, the more
vulnerable the seeker becomes, amplifying the insecurity. In the end,
both are left exposed - security vanishes for all.  
</p>
<p class="western" align="left" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" align="left" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">
•	Consideration. An individual leans on a partner for constant
reassurance that their feelings and perspectives matter, outsourcing
their sense of being valued. The partner, burdened by the relentless
need for validation, begins to feel unheard themselves, their own
considerations neglected. Exhausted, they pull back, leaving the
seeker feeling even more disregarded. What was meant to ensure mutual
care instead breeds frustration - consideration erodes for both.</p>
<p class="western" align="left" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" align="left" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">
•	Love and Affection. Someone clings to a partner, needing their
love as proof of worth, outsourcing self-acceptance. The partner,
feeling suffocated by the need, begins to withdraw, their own desire
to give affection dulled by obligation. The seeker, sensing the
distance, panics and grasps tighter, driving the cycle deeper. Love,
meant to be freely given, dissolves under pressure - both are left
cold and disconnected.</p>
<p class="western" align="left" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" align="left" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">
•	Acceptance and Belonging. An individual relies on a group or
partner to affirm their worth, bending to fit expectations in fear of
rejection. The group, feeling the weight of their dependency, starts
to distance themselves, resenting the responsibility of maintaining
another’s identity. As the individual feels less accepted, they
seek approval more desperately, feeding the alienation. What was
sought - belonging - disintegrates, leaving all parties estranged.</p>
<p class="western" align="left" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" align="left" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">
•	Trust. A person places all trust in another, outsourcing
discernment and self-assurance. The trusted individual, knowing they
bear the full weight of another’s faith, feels trapped - any
mistake, any doubt, becomes catastrophic. Eventually, the strain
erodes their reliability, and cracks appear. The seeker, sensing the
instability, grows paranoid and doubtful, feeding cycles of betrayal.
Trust collapses for both - the dependent feels deceived, the provider
feels accused.</p>
<p class="western" align="left" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">
(Less dependency-prone needs include cooperation, communication, and
mutuality, which imply reciprocity rather than one-sided reliance.)</p>
<p class="western" align="left" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">

PHYSICAL WELL-BEING</p>
<p class="western" align="left" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">
Most needs here - movement/exercise, sleep, sexual expression, touch,
air, food, nutrition, rest, hydration, elimination, growth - are
fundamentally individual, but outsourcing certain aspects can still
create dynamics:</p>
<p class="western" align="left" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">
•	Shelter and Safe-Space. An individual seeks refuge in a partner’s
home or emotional presence, making them the sole source of comfort.
The partner, overwhelmed by the responsibility of providing
sanctuary, begins to feel burdened, their own sense of safety
threatened by the imbalance. The more the seeker leans, the more the
foundation buckles, leaving both ungrounded. What was meant to be a
haven becomes a battleground - safety crumbles under the weight of
dependence.</p>
<p class="western" align="left" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" align="left" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">
•	Touch and Sexual Expression. One partner places the entirety of
their physical intimacy needs on the other, depending on them for
touch, connection, and validation. The other, feeling pressured
rather than desired, begins to withdraw, their own relationship with
intimacy strained by obligation. The seeker, feeling unwanted, clings
harder, demanding more. Desire suffocates under expectation - neither
finds fulfillment, and connection fades.</p>
<p class="western" align="left" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" align="left" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">
•	Nourishment. A person depends on another to feed them - whether
physically, emotionally, or spiritually - outsourcing the effort of
self-sustenance. The provider, drained by the one-way exchange,
begins to withhold, struggling to nourish themselves. The seeker, now
deprived, grows desperate and demanding, accelerating the depletion.
What was abundant now withers - neither is fed, and both are left
hollow.</p>
<p class="western" align="left" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">
•	Flow. A creative depends on a collaborator to drive momentum,
outsourcing their own ability to enter a state of inspired
productivity. The collaborator, weighed down by the responsibility,
begins to falter, their own enthusiasm drained by the pressure to
perform. Inspiration stagnates, progress halts, and tension builds -
flow, once the goal, is now the casualty of dependence.</p>
<p class="western" align="left" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">
(Needs like air, sleep, or hydration are less relational and harder
to outsource in a dependency sense, as they’re more self-managed.)</p>
<p class="western" align="left" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">

HONESTY (ELUCIDATION)</p>
<p class="western" align="left" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">
This category - authenticity, integrity, presence, joy, humor, fun,
adventure - is largely internal, but outsourcing can still apply:</p>
<p class="western" align="left" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">
•	Joy, Fun, and Adventure. An individual looks to a friend or
partner as their source of excitement, placing the burden of
spontaneity and happiness onto them. The provider, worn down by the
expectation, loses their own enthusiasm, fun becoming a duty rather
than a shared experience. The seeker, receiving less, pushes harder,
making joy feel like a demand rather than a delight. In the end, both
are drained - laughter fades, and adventure turns to obligation.</p>
<p class="western" align="left" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" align="left" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">
•	Presence. A person expects another to be endlessly present for
them, needing constant attention and validation. The provider,
exhausted by the demand, begins to disengage, their own ability to be
present fading under pressure. The seeker, sensing this, grows
restless and insecure, clinging harder. Presence, once sought as
connection, transforms into absence - neither feels truly seen.</p>
<p class="western" align="left" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">
(Integrity and authenticity are harder to outsource - they’re
self-rooted - so dependency is less likely here.)</p>
<p class="western" align="left" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">

PEACE</p>
<p class="western" align="left" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">
•	Beauty, Communion, Harmony, and Inspiration. Someone depends on a
partner to create an atmosphere of peace, order, or creative energy,
outsourcing their own engagement with these qualities. The partner,
feeling responsible for sustaining the experience, begins to feel
drained, their own sense of ease disrupted by duty. As they falter,
the seeker grows anxious, grasping for the fading harmony. What was
meant to be uplifting becomes exhausting - beauty, once abundant, now
feels like a burden.</p>
<p class="western" align="left" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" align="left" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">
•	Ease. An individual relies on a roommate to handle household
responsibilities, outsourcing their sense of comfort and order. The
roommate, feeling unappreciated and burdened by the imbalance, begins
to withdraw their efforts, their own peace disrupted by resentment.
As responsibilities go unmet, the seeker’s stress mounts, and the
once-stable home environment fractures. What was meant to provide
ease instead breeds tension - neither finds relief.</p>
<p class="western" align="left" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">
•	Order. An individual relies on another to structure their world -
be it a home, a schedule, or their thoughts. The provider, burdened
by the endless responsibility, begins to resist, their own sense of
order unraveling under the weight. The seeker, lost without guidance,
grows more chaotic. What was meant to bring stability instead fosters
disorder - both are left overwhelmed.</p>
<p class="western" align="left" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" align="left" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">
•	Equality. A person expects another to constantly affirm their
equal standing, demanding reassurance that they are valued and
treated fairly. The provider, forced into the role of balancing
perceptions, grows weary, resenting the obligation to monitor
fairness. The more they pull away, the more the seeker feels
diminished, demanding even more validation. What was meant to foster
mutual respect breeds exhaustion - equality warps into imbalance.</p>
<p class="western" align="left" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">

AUTONOMY</p>
<p class="western" align="left" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">
Ironically, outsourcing autonomy-related needs - choice, freedom,
independence, space, spontaneity - defeats their essence:</p>
<p class="western" align="left" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">
•	Space or Freedom. Someone depends on another to grant them
permission for independence, making their autonomy subject to
another’s will. The provider, feeling the burden of controlling
another’s freedom, becomes frustrated and resentful, feeling
trapped by their role as gatekeeper. The more control they hold, the
more confined they feel. What was meant to create space instead
breeds suffocation - both are left constrained.</p>
<p class="western" align="left" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">

MEANING</p>
<p class="western" align="left" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">
This category - awareness, celebration of life, challenge, clarity,
competence, contribution, creativity, growth, hope, learning,
purpose, self-expression, understanding - is rich with internal
potential, but some needs invite dependency:</p>
<p class="western" align="left" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">
•	Approval, Being Liked, Being Loved, Being Esteemed, Being Wanted.
An individual relies on external validation to feel worthy,
outsourcing self-respect. The provider, overwhelmed by the
responsibility of maintaining another’s self-esteem, withdraws,
their appreciation dulled by obligation. The seeker, feeling less
seen, becomes more desperate, accelerating the erosion. What was once
freely given becomes a burden - esteem vanishes for both.</p>
<p class="western" align="left" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" align="left" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">
•	Mourning. An individual leans on friends to carry them through
grief, outsourcing their ability to process loss. The friends,
initially supportive, begin to feel overwhelmed, their own emotional
reserves depleted by the weight of another’s sorrow. Unable to
sustain the dynamic, they withdraw, leaving the seeker feeling
abandoned. What was meant to foster healing instead deepens isolation
- mourning becomes stunted for all involved.</p>
<p class="western" align="left" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" align="left" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">
•	Trust in Something Greater. An individual places their faith in
another - be it a partner, leader, or guru - as the foundation of
their belief system. The provider, now burdened with maintaining
another’s existential security, begins to doubt themselves, their
own faith cracking under pressure. When their stability falters, the
seeker’s world collapses. What was meant to provide meaning instead
fosters disillusionment - both are left unmoored.</p>
<p class="western" align="left" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">
(Needs like companionship, creativity, awareness, or purpose are less
dependency-prone when kept internal, though outsourcing them (e.g.,
needing others to define your purpose) could still strain
relationships.)</p>

Belief Inference Process (Concise Guide)</p>
<p class="western" align="left" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">
Step 1: Surface the Pattern</p>
<p class="western" align="left" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">
Describe a recurring situation in your life that causes frustration,
exhaustion, or quiet despair - or one where you're compulsively
attached to a role or behavior despite its cost.</p>
<p class="western" align="left" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">
Look for subtle gleeful reactions in inappropriate contexts or overly
“noble” roles that secretly drain you.</p>
<p class="western" align="left" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">
🔧 Ask yourself:</p>
<p class="western" align="left" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">
•	What do I keep doing even when it hurts?</p>
<p class="western" align="left" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">
•	What roles would collapse if I stopped performing them?</p>
<p class="western" align="left" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">
________________________________________</p>
<p class="western" align="left" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">
Step 2: Identify the Vice Response</p>
<p class="western" align="left" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">
What reactive or ‘negative’ emotional response arises in these
moments? Is it anger, shame, fear, bitterness, resentment, or
collapse?</p>
<p class="western" align="left" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">
This reaction is your protection strategy - a vice designed to shield
you from unbearable emotional exposure.</p>
<p class="western" align="left" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">
🔧 Clarify:</p>
<p class="western" align="left" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">
Is it active (rage, control)? Passive (withdrawal, coldness)?</p>
<p class="western" align="left" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">
Does it isolate you or make connection harder?</p>
<p class="western" align="left" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">
________________________________________</p>
<p class="western" align="left" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">
Step 3: Determine the Aggravated Need</p>
<p class="western" align="left" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">
What are you trying to get, avoid, or protect in this situation? Use
the Needs list.</p>
<p class="western" align="left" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">
Is this need showing up as compulsion (you chase it), aversion (you
avoid it), or dependency (you outsource it)?</p>
<p class="western" align="left" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">
🔧 Key Insight:</p>
<p class="western" align="left" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">
This is not just a missing need - it’s a distorted need. It's been
overburdened with meaning or denied so often that you can't relate to
it cleanly anymore.</p>
<p class="western" align="left" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">
________________________________________</p>
<p class="western" align="left" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">
Step 4: Recall the Earliest Memory of This Pattern</p>
<p class="western" align="left" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">
What’s the first time you remember this dynamic happening?</p>
<p class="western" align="left" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">
Who was involved, and what was the emotional climate?</p>
<p class="western" align="left" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">
🔧 Look for:</p>
<p class="western" align="left" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">
•	What you adapted to survive.</p>
<p class="western" align="left" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">
•	Early emotional atmospheres that felt confusing, unsafe, or
invisible.</p>
<p class="western" align="left" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">
________________________________________</p>
<p class="western" align="left" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">
Step 5: Identify the Exiled Emotion</p>
<p class="western" align="left" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">
What unbearable emotional state did you experience in that early
moment - so painful that you vowed (often subconsciously) never to
feel it again?</p>
<p class="western" align="left" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">
🔧 This is the emotion your vice (Step 2) is designed to suppress.</p>
<p class="western" align="left" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">
Feelings like shame, helplessness, guilt, or abandonment often anchor
the whole pattern.</p>
<p class="western" align="left" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">
________________________________________</p>
<p class="western" align="left" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">
Step 6: Identify the Original Unmet Need</p>
<p class="western" align="left" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">
What was most missing in that early moment?</p>
<p class="western" align="left" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">
What care, recognition, or emotional nourishment would have made the
scene safe or coherent?</p>
<p class="western" align="left" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">
🔧 This is the root unmet need - the one your belief formed to
protect.</p>
<p class="western" align="left" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">
You likely abandoned, over-performed for, or outsourced this need
ever since.</p>
<p class="western" align="left" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">
________________________________________</p>
<p class="western" align="left" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">
Step 7: Trace the Origin Pattern Logic</p>
<p class="western" align="left" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">
What did your environment consistently teach you - implicitly or
explicitly - about this need?</p>
<p class="western" align="left" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">
🔧 Ask:</p>
<p class="western" align="left" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">
“What would I have had to believe to stay safe or sane in that
environment?”</p>
<p class="western" align="left" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">
This isn’t the belief itself yet - just the internal logic that
made it necessary.</p>
<p class="western" align="left" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">
________________________________________</p>
<p class="western" align="left" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">
Step 8: Infer the Core Belief</p>
<p class="western" align="left" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">
Write the subconscious belief you formed to explain and protect
against the pain.</p>
<p class="western" align="left" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">
“I must...”, “People are...”, “The world is...” etc.</p>
<p class="western" align="left" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">
🔧 Remember:</p>
<p class="western" align="left" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">
Beliefs are not just wrong ideas. They are emotional protection
contracts - adaptive, not logical.</p>
<p class="western" align="left" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">
They helped you survive - but now they distort reality and restrict
your options.</p>
<p class="western" align="left" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">
________________________________________</p>
<p class="western" align="left" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">
Step 9: Validate the Belief via Behavior</p>
<p class="western" align="left" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">
How do your compulsions and aversions (from Steps 1–3) support this
belief?</p>
<p class="western" align="left" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">
🔧 Check:</p>
<p class="western" align="left" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">
•	Do you avoid situations that could contradict it?</p>
<p class="western" align="left" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">
•	Does your behavior ensure the belief is never tested - or always
confirmed?</p>
<p class="western" align="left" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">
________________________________________</p>
<p class="western" align="left" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">
Step 10: Validate the Belief via Resistance</p>
<p class="western" align="left" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">
Now flip the belief. Say the opposite out loud.</p>
<p class="western" align="left" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">
What happens inside you?</p>
<p class="western" align="left" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">
🔧 Track your internal resistance:</p>
<p class="western" align="left" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">
•	Cynical doubt: “Yeah right/that’s naive.”</p>
<p class="western" align="left" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">
•	Skeptical doubt: “No evidence/where’s the proof?”</p>
<p class="western" align="left" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">
•	External blame: “Other people are the problem.”</p>
<p class="western" align="left" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">
•	Harsh self-attack: “This is what’s wrong with you.”</p>
<p class="western" align="left" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">
These voices are the belief’s immune system - defenses against
contradiction.</p>
<p class="western" align="left" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">

What part of you had to stay hidden because of the belief?</p>
<p class="western" align="left" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">
What couldn’t you do, say, become, or express?</p>

🔧 Imagine a character following your belief on a stage:</p>

What do they avoid?</p>
<p class="western" align="left" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">
What traits do they suppress?</p>

<p class="western" align="left" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">
Prepare for reactivity. Don’t pathologize it.</p>
<p class="western" align="left" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">

The process doesn’t just remove a belief - it removes the armor
that kept you safe.</p>
<p class="western" align="left" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">
Make room for the tenderness underneath. And stay with it.</p>
