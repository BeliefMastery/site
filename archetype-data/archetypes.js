    reproductiveDescription: 'Achieves reproduction through high mate access and seed spread, but typically lacks long-term relationship loyalty. High initial attraction but poor retention.',
    // Archetypal Narrative - The brutal truth of this archetype's typical life pattern
    archetypalNarrative: 'You command attention and respect naturally. People look to you for leadership, and you deliver. You achieve reproduction through multiple partners and high mate access, but struggle with long-term loyalty. Relationships start strong with your charisma and authority, then fail when your need for control or variety creates conflict. You may have multiple children from different partners, but lack deep family bonds. Your status keeps you in the game, but your inability to maintain commitment means you age alone despite early success. You trade depth for breadth, intimacy for influence. The truth: you lead but rarely connect, conquer but seldom build.',
    explanation: 'The Alpha archetype represents natural leadership and authority. In psychological terms, this aligns with mature masculine energy that takes responsibility and commands respect through competence rather than force. The term "Alpha" in this context refers to social positioning and behavioral patterns, not biological dominance.'

    archetypalNarrative: 'You earn respect by protecting people, but you become defined by crisis. You build your identity around strength and service, and quietly resent anyone who does not appreciate the cost. You win battles, but the constant posture of defense keeps intimacy at a distance.

    archetypalNarrative: 'You are the reliable second choice. Your partner chose you after their Alpha relationship failed - they wanted the security and devotion you provide, but you know you were not their first choice. You achieve reproduction, but in a resentful dynamic where you give more than you receive. You suppress your needs to maintain harmony, accumulating resentment over years. Your children see your submission and internalize that pattern. You may succeed in reproduction, but you fail in self-respect.

    // Archetypal Narrative - The brutal truth of this archetype's typical life pattern
    archetypalNarrative: 'You see through the bullshit, and that\'s your curse. Your intellectual depth and authentic questioning of norms make you fascinating but inaccessible. You watch as less insightful men achieve reproduction while you remain alone, misunderstood, or stuck in situationships that never progress. Your depth intimidates potential partners, and your refusal to play social games means you miss opportunities. You may rationalize this as "choosing authenticity," but the truth is you chose knowledge over connection, and now you face the consequences: few or no children, aging alone, your intellectual insights dying with you. The truth: you understood the game but refused to play it, and now you\'ve lost without ever really competing.',

    // Archetypal Narrative - The brutal truth of this archetype's typical life pattern
    archetypalNarrative: 'You are the practical choice - reliable, stable, and good at provisioning. You achieve reproduction because you represent security and competence. Your partner chose you for your practical value, not your charisma or status. You work hard, provide well, and build stable families. But you may always wonder if your partner would have preferred an Alpha if one had been available. Your children respect you for your reliability but may not be inspired by your lack of dominance. You succeed where others fail: long-term relationships, stable families, consistent provision. The truth: you won through competence and reliability, trading excitement for stability, charisma for dependability. You are valued but perhaps not desired, respected but rarely envied.',

    archetypalNarrative: 'You chose independence over connection, and now you have it. You operate outside social hierarchies, valuing your autonomy above all else. This freedom comes at the cost of reproduction - you miss out because you refuse to play the mating game, to compete for status, to compromise your independence for partnership. You may rationalize this as "choosing freedom," but the reality is you chose isolation over reproduction. As you age alone, you may find your independence less satisfying than you imagined.
