## 1. Male: Bad Boy / Good Guy grid

**Good Guy thresholds:** hi ≥70%, upper-mid 55–69%, mid 40–54%, lower-mid 25–39%, lo &lt;25%  
**Bad Boy thresholds:** hi ≥70%, mid 40–69%, lo &lt;40%

| Good Guy | Bad Boy | Label | Explanation |
|----------|---------|-------|-------------|
| hi | hi | Prince Charming (Ideal Long Term) | Women see you as ideal long-term: high on both manner/provision and attraction. |
| hi | mid | Husband zone | Women see you as strong long-term material: high manner/provision and solid attraction. |
| hi | lo | Friend zone | Women value you for provision and reliability but don't feel the attraction; they keep you around without romantic intent. |
| upper-mid | hi | Good Situationship | Upper-mid provision, high attraction; relationship is ambiguous but has good foundations and could move toward commitment. |
| mid | hi | Situationship | Moderate provision, high attraction; women are drawn but don't see clear commitment. |
| lower-mid | hi | Bad Situationship | Lower-mid provision, high attraction; women engage but see weak foundations; unlikely to deepen. |
| upper-mid | mid | Good Settling | Upper-mid on both axes; women accept you as "good enough" — workable but not exciting. |
| mid | mid | Settling | Moderate on both axes; women may accept but not be excited. |
| lower-mid | mid | Bad Settling | Lower-mid provision, moderate attraction; women settle for provision rather than desire. |
| upper-mid | lo | Comfortable Compromise | Upper-mid provision, low attraction; women may be with you for what you provide; acceptable. |
| mid | lo | Resource Compromise | Moderate provision, low attraction; women may be with you primarily for what you provide. |
| lower-mid | lo | Last Resort | Lower-mid provision, low attraction; women are barely engaged; fragile. |
| lo | hi | Bad Boy Fun Time (Short Term) | Women attracted short-term but don't see you as long-term material. |
| lo | mid | ... Mistake | Women may engage for fun but typically don't see it lasting. |
| lo | lo | Invisible/Ghost or Creep | Women categorise you as invisible or threatening; they avoid or disengage. |

## 2. Female: Keeper / Sleeper / Sweeper

**Axis:** overall SMV percentile

| Segment | SMV range | Current label | Description | Investment |
|---------|-----------|---------------|-------------|------------|
| keepers | ≥80% | Keepers | My one and only | More Investment |
| sleepers | 40–79% | Sleepers | I dunno where I'm gonna be in 3 weeks, ya know? | — |
| sweepers | &lt;40% | Sweepers | (Under the rug) | LESS Investment |

**Explanation texts:**
- **Keepers:** Men you attract are likely to invest in you for the long term: they'd commit to and prioritise you.
- **Sleepers:** The middle zone — men are open to you but not fully committed; they'd consider you but may not prioritise you.
- **Sweepers:** Men you attract are likely to treat you with less investment: they'll engage casually or de-prioritise you relative to women they see as higher value.
